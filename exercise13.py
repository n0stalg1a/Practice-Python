# 13: Fibonacci
# Write a program that asks the user how many Fibonnaci numbers 
# to generate and then generates them. Take this opportunity to 
# think about how you can use functions. Make sure to ask the user 
# to enter the number of numbers in the sequence to generate.
# (Hint: The Fibonnaci seqence is a sequence of numbers where the 
# next number in the sequence is the sum of the previous two numbers 
# in the sequence. The sequence looks like this: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, â€¦)
